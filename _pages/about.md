Welcome! I am a first year PhD student at [LAMSADE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/), at [Universit√© Paris Dauphine](https://dauphine.psl.eu/).
My PhD is supervised by prof. [Michael Lampis](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~mlampis/index.html).
My research interests lie in the area of Theoretical Computer Science,
and in particular appriximation/parameterized algorithms as well as fine-grained complexity.

Before joining LAMSADE, I received a diploma in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en),
from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/),
where I was supervised by prof. [Aris Pagourtzis](http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~pagour/).
